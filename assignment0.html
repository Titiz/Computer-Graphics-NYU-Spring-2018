<h1> About Myself </h1>
<p> My name is Titas Geryba and I am a student from the Abu Dhabi campus of NYU. 
    I am majoring in mathematics and minoring in Computer Science. 
    My primary interests outside of academia involve walking, hiking, basketball, music listening and, perhaps
    most relevant to this course, video games. </p>

<h1> Why Take this course </h1>

<p> My first and primary interest in this course is understanding the mathematics and reasoning behind the way
computers represent 3D graphics on a two dimensional screen. In the process I wish to also learn the basic principles,
intuitions and easy ways to interpret what the GPU is doing to accomplish the feats that we see. Finally, I wish
to gain some adept skills at being able to program some of these things effectively and get an understanding of how I could
create my own variations of graphics and graphical effects in the future.
</p>

<h1> What would I like to see in this course </h1>
<p>
I have always been told that linear algebra and quanternions are very useful in representing 3D graphics. This is what would
really excite me in the classroom - the theory behind all of this. I want to see how it is connected and the intuition behind
connecting 3D graphics, essentially a way to represent the real world, with the aspects of abstract and linear algebra. 
I feel like this
would give me a better understanding of algebra as a modelling tool and give me a good grasp of what it means to 
manipulate objects in three dimensions. 
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I really want hands-on stuff. I want to program movement and creations of shapes while understanding the algorithms
behind them. I want to gain the ability to write code that deals with graphics
 fairly efficiently, so a lot of practice with valuable feedback
would be great. To have an idea of how certain graphics are implemented in media I consume, going over certain examples like 
the movies we have seen so far and breaking them down would be of great help. If possible, I would also love to see examples from 
video games.

Over time, I hope the theory, in combination with practice and the examination of existing examples would help me understand 
how to produce my own graphics effects without being explicitly told or shown how the implementation should be done.
