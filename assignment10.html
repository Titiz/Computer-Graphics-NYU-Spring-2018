<h1> Implications of the Lecture by Luiz Velho </h1>
<p>
This week we were asked to talk about the implications of the content given by two guest lecturers, Luiz Velho and Sebastian Herscher. I have decided to focus on the talk given by Luiz Velho. During the lecture, Luiz Velho described a project he and his team undertook. The project was a real-time acted VR movie based on scenes of the Tempest by William Shakespeare. In this performance the audience was shown a graphically generated world and characters, but instead of the characters being pre-animated, actors in a neighboring room with VR tools would act out the actions and dialogue of these characters. With some diffuculty, but because of good planning and preparation, Luiz Velho deemed it a success.
</p>
<p>
So why is this project of interest to us? Well according to Luiz Velho this was the first production of this kind. This gives implications for a possible future medium of entertainment and story-telling. Instead of going to the theatre where everything is played out by actors with limited real-life props, one could instead have actors act out on a virtual stage with unlimited potential. An example of this was the staff that Luiz Velho described, which allowed the actors to cast a water spell. This could be extended infinitely to the point where you could have actors having full - fledged magic battles, terraform the environment to create things such as earthquakes or just having really nice particle and visual effects to set mood to scenes. All of these options would also be completely free to the actors and producer, so each production of the same play could be done completely differently. This variety and visual appeal could become an attraction to a lot of people and give people who do not watch theater a new way to experience the stories that are told in thme.

To further touch on the development of VR in this manner, not only plays could be performed, but some form of group interaction could be formed. If all members of the audience could get their hands on a VR-set and had a little bit of room to move around, they could be part of a shared experience where either predefined actions happen, or, just like in Velho's production, real actors would guide users through an experience. Whether it be an interactive Dungeons and Dragons experience, or the group of users experiencing the life on a pirate ship for a couple of hours, the potential, again, would only be limited by graphical complexity and imagination. Thus this would give a completely new medium that is like a mixture of a video game and a movie. One might even suggest that this would attract more of an audience than video games do, as they take what's best of both genres. These kind of personalized and sharable experiences could become the new medium that people could enjoy instead of going to the movies and playing games. We see then that not only does this new technological development have the potential to push the act of story-telling in new directions, but also gives hope for a more interactive method of performance that would engage and immerse every single member of the audience.
</p>
<p>
From this one small project by Luiz Velho we see thus that VR still has a lot of untapped potential. In the future, as this technology gets more accessible, there is a lot of ways it could be integrated into the traditional form of story-telling and entertainment that we are so used to. It will be of interest to see how the public will react to this new development and how this will change the popular movie and theatre genre that we are all so accustomed to.
